I started hiking recently (June'21) by using it as a reason to get outside the house, and I currently love this hobby. I made a goal of completing 30 new trails by the end of summer. You can find my progress below,

<!-- <div class="progress">
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-success" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="10"
  aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width:10%">
    10% Complete (3/30)
  </div>
</div> -->

<label for="file">Downloading progress:</label>
<progress id="file" value="32" max="100"> 32% </progress>

Here on this page, I will post some pics from each trail and maybe say something about them if I find the need. To see the original resolution picture, right-click and open the image in a new tab, or download the image.
