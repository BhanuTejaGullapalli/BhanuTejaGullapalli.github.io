As your curiousity has led you here (and I'm sure to many others places), I will take the most attentive part of your time to present my research:  
I utilize multimodal physiological data from wearable devices, along with individual's demographic characterstics (age,gender,comorbidities,etc.), to develop digital biomarkers in the space of substance use addiction. Primarly, I work with mobile-sensor data collected in both hospital settings and the real world to predict various aspects of the addiction cycle for different drugs.

If you still have attention and time, let me put my research journey in a short-story:-  
## Act 1
With a curiousity and determination to push the boundaries of research (thanks to my persistent undergraduate friends who never stopped talking about it) and make it possible to transition to real-world. I made the leap to the U.S. in 2017, shortly after my undergraduate studies, to pursue a Master's degree and discover my research interests.  
To my surprise, I discovered machine learning—a field within computer science previously unknown to me—which focused on addressing real-world problems. This revelation led me to enroll in related courses and work in research labs specializing in the field. A happy little coincidence was that my first research project in these labs revolved around smoking cessation relapse using smartwatch data. (CUT TO)..  
Almost a year later, with my pressumed understanding and confidence in machine-learning, I knocked on the the door of Tauhidur Rahman, seeking a long-term research problem and his advising.

Hi, I'm Bhanu Teja Gullapalli; thanks for visiting my website. I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at the University of California San Diego advised by   [Tauhidur Rahman](http://www.tauhidurrahman.com/).

As a member of [Mosaic Lab](http://mosaic.cs.umass.edu/), I focus on machine learning and ubiquitous technologies in the medical domain. I am primarily interested in developing machine learning algorithms that understand the time-series physiological signals collected from wearable devices to predict and explain various behavioral variables associated with substance usage and addiction. 

In the past, I have worked as a research intern at [Samsung Digital Health Lab](https://www.sra.samsung.com/digital-health/). I joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a Master's student in 2017 and moved to MS/Ph.D. track in 2018. After spending four wonderful years there, I transferred to the University of California San Diego. I did my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology -Guwahati (IITG), where I completed my thesis under the supervision of [Samit Bhattacharya](http://www.iitg.ac.in/samit/) and [Benny George](https://www.iitg.ac.in/ben/).
