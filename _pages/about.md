Hi, I'm Bhanu Teja Gullapalli; thanks for visiting my website. I am a <del>first</del> second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst advised by   [Tauhidur Rahman](http://www.tauhidurrahman.com/).

As a member of [Mosaic Lab](http://mosaic.cs.umass.edu/), I focus on machine learning and ubiquitous technologies in the medical domain.  

Previously, I joined University of Massachusetts Amherst as Master's student in 2017 and moved to MS/Ph.D track in 2019. I did my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology -Guwahati (IITG) where I worked under [Samit Bhattacharya](http://www.iitg.ac.in/samit/) and [Benny George](https://www.iitg.ac.in/ben/).
