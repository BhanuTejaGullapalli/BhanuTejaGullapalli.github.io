As your curiousity has led you here (and I'm sure to many places), I will take your most attentive part of the time to pitch my research:  

I use the multimodal physiological data from wearable devices like smartwatches along with an individual's demographical characterstics (age,gender,comorbidities,etc) to develop digital biomarkers in the space of substance usage addiction. Primarly, I worked with mobile-sensor data collected from hospital-, and real-world settings to predict different aspects of an addiction cycle

Hi, I'm Bhanu Teja Gullapalli; thanks for visiting my website. I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at the University of California San Diego advised by   [Tauhidur Rahman](http://www.tauhidurrahman.com/).

As a member of [Mosaic Lab](http://mosaic.cs.umass.edu/), I focus on machine learning and ubiquitous technologies in the medical domain. I am primarily interested in developing machine learning algorithms that understand the time-series physiological signals collected from wearable devices to predict and explain various behavioral variables associated with substance usage and addiction. 

In the past, I have worked as a research intern at [Samsung Digital Health Lab](https://www.sra.samsung.com/digital-health/). I joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a Master's student in 2017 and moved to MS/Ph.D. track in 2018. After spending four wonderful years there, I transferred to the University of California San Diego. I did my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology -Guwahati (IITG), where I completed my thesis under the supervision of [Samit Bhattacharya](http://www.iitg.ac.in/samit/) and [Benny George](https://www.iitg.ac.in/ben/). 

I like to check out places around me, play badminton, board games, and go on long drives in my free time. I started hiking actively last year ([my list](https://www.alltrails.com/members/bhanu-gullapalli/completed)). At present, I am trying to learn more about stars.
