As your curiousity has led you here (and I'm sure to many others places), I will take the most attentive part of your time to present my research first:  
I utilize multimodal physiological data from wearable devices, along with individual's demographic characterstics (age,comorbidities,etc.), to develop *digital biomarkers in the space of substance use addiction*. Primarly, I work with mobile-sensor data collected in both hospital settings and the real world to predict various aspects of the addiction cycle for different drugs.

  <figcaption>A quick illustartion of my work. I solemnly swear all the data I worked on in my research has been collected in a consented manner except for this picture taken by <a href="https://www.tauhidurrahman.com/"> Tauhidur Rahman </a> .</figcaption>

  If you still have attention and time, two common things recurring in all my projects, let me put MY unfinished research journey in a short-story that reads less technical and sounds more luckier :-  
## Act 1
(COUGH,COUGH) With a curiousity to push the boundaries of research (no, seriously, thanks to my persistent undergraduate friends who never stopped talking about it) and to see if I can push mine to real-world, shortly after my undergraduate studies I made a leap to U.S. in 2017 for Master's and discover my research interests for PhD.  
To my surprise (not-so now), I discovered machine learning—a field within computer science previously unknown to me—which focused on addressing real-world problems. This curiousity led me to enroll in related courses and work in research labs focussing on related field and working on real-world problems.  
A little luck (one of many Felix Felicis of this story) was that my first research project in these labs revolved around health and wearable data in substance addiction introducing me to *mobile-health data* and *digital biomarker*.  
CUT TO...  
Almost a year later, with my pressumed understanding and confidence in machine-learning, I met <a href="https://www.tauhidurrahman.com/"> Tauhidur Rahman </a> for the first time, and requested a long-term research problem and his advising.

## Act 2
Of course as one (un-?)expected... this idea was gently put down by him and a more (un-?)realistic and short-term project was advised as a start. Another little luck, this project was also on wearable and substance use addiction. With promising results I submmited the paper and with this semi-promising hope I started my PhD in this direction of research.  
CUT TO...  
Few months later, working on a larger scale dataset of this project with more uncontrolled parameters, it was easy finding a hypothesis here but it was not so easy to clean the noise in these datasets to solve for that hypothesis.  
Another little luck, during this disproportionate  Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time, I came across upon a <a href="https://umasstox.com/">group of medical researchers</a> (<2 hr drive away!) who collected wearable data from a large scale participants with SNR ahead of that time and willing to colloborate.  
Of course, once again, as expected with any other PhD project, this started with countless bad hypothesis before finding the right one. Our findings were made public, simultaneously I wanted to make the best use of the snow around me in Amherst by learning to ski.  
CUT TO...  
Few weeks later, another little luck, just when I thought I exhausted all my research ideas on next directions. I met another medical researcher from Utah, <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u0889676-Eric_L_Garland/research/index.hml">  Eric L Garland</a>, who read our findings, was engaged in a research problem that perfectly aligned with my own work, leading us to initiate a remote collaboration. 
This project started, winter ended. I learnt skiing and found a balance betweek ski time and research time. *snap*  
Just like a ski turn, I transfered to ~~San~~ Sun Diego city.

Hi, I'm Bhanu Teja Gullapalli; thanks for visiting my website. I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at the University of California San Diego advised by   [Tauhidur Rahman](http://www.tauhidurrahman.com/).

As a member of [Mosaic Lab](http://mosaic.cs.umass.edu/), I focus on machine learning and ubiquitous technologies in the medical domain. I am primarily interested in developing machine learning algorithms that understand the time-series physiological signals collected from wearable devices to predict and explain various behavioral variables associated with substance usage and addiction. 

In the past, I have worked as a research intern at [Samsung Digital Health Lab](https://www.sra.samsung.com/digital-health/). I joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a Master's student in 2017 and moved to MS/Ph.D. track in 2018. After spending four wonderful years there, I transferred to the University of California San Diego. I did my undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology -Guwahati (IITG), where I completed my thesis under the supervision of [Samit Bhattacharya](http://www.iitg.ac.in/samit/) and [Benny George](https://www.iitg.ac.in/ben/). 

I like to check out places around me, play badminton, board games, and go on long drives in my free time. I started hiking actively last year ([my list](https://www.alltrails.com/members/bhanu-gullapalli/completed)). At present, I am trying to learn more about stars.
